                    <p>Take full advantage of your KIN membership with a dedicated desk. It comes with a storage cabinet underneath, but you can feel free to leave your stuff on top. Either way, it’ll be safe. We’re family here.

                    <p>You have a KIN membership, but hang out on your own terms. That means you have a hot desk and can float around wherever, whenever you like.</p>
