            <p><strong>Overview. </strong> These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) describe your rights and obligations in connection with your receipt and use of the services provided by WeWork in connection with your We Membership, Hot Desk, Daily Desk, Conference Room or other services specified herein (the “Services”, as further described below).
            </p>
            <p>Please read these Terms carefully, as they affect your legal rights. Among other things, these Terms include your agreement that except for certain types of disputes described in the “Governing Law; Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” section below, you agree that disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration and you waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact joinus@wework.com. By using the Services, you are agreeing to abide by and be bound by these Terms.</p>
          </dt>
          <dt>
            <p><strong>Who we are.</strong> We create online and physical communities for creators. Who we are for the purposes of these Terms is the WeWork Companies Inc. affiliate set forth on your invoice and will depend on (i) where the Services are deemed to be rendered or (ii) where your primary Premises (if applicable) is located. We reserve the right to change the legal entity that charges you for the Services.</p>
            <p>The relevant entity with which you enter into these Terms shall be known in these Terms as “we,” “our” “us” or “WeWork”.</p>

          <dt>
            <p><strong>Who you are.</strong> References to “you,” “your” and similar words in these Terms refer to the individual or entity registering for any Services and agreeing to be bound by these Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary right, authority and consent to bind such entity to these Terms. Also, if you are based outside of the US, by agreeing to these Terms, you are confirming that you are using the Services for business purposes and not as a consumer (as defined in Regulation 4 of the UK Consumer Contracts Regulations).</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            “Services” do not include, and we are not involved in or liable for, the provision of products or services by third parties (“Third Party Services”) that you may elect to purchase in connection with your We Membership or Hot Desk, such as group health insurance, gym memberships or payroll services. Third Party Services are provided solely by the applicable third party (“Third Party Service Providers”) and pursuant to separate arrangements between you and the applicable Third Party Service Providers. These Third Party Service Providers’ terms and conditions will control with respect to the relevant Third Party Services.<br>
            Some features of the Services may be subject to Additional Terms, which will be posted with those features or otherwise communicated to you. We will consider your use of those features your acceptance of the applicable Additional Terms, and those Additional Terms will be incorporated in these Terms by this reference.</p>
