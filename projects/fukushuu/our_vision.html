                                    <h6>BAR MANAGER AND MIXOLOGIST</h6>
                                    <p>Matt is a Tucson native who is no stranger to the city’s restaurant and bar scene.  He spent two years as a sushi chef, learning technique and foundation from Manhattan transplant, Fei Cheng.  It was this experience that reinforced for Matt the concept, “mis en place”.  Prior to Umi Star’s closing in January 2014, Matt worked as head chef and manager there, during which time he created and executed an entirely new menu.</p>
                                    <p>Shortly thereafter, Matt worked at Nox as a bartender, but soon took his mixology skills over to 47 Scott.  During his time with Scott & Co., he helped create both seasonal and special events menus, along with his invention of 10 new and exciting cocktails.  His intelligent mixing and creativity is what earned Matt a trip to Louisville, Kentucky, as a regional winner of the Woodford Reserve Manhattan Experience.</p>
                                    <p>Matt’s immediate plans for Obon’s bar will include a list of rotating classics, Japanese-influenced original cocktails, together with a widely varied sake list.  The fun won’t stop there, though, as Matt has visions of punch bowls, exotic, large-format cocktails and (fingers crossed) a frozen drink machine.  Matt is excited to bring a high quality bar to the busiest street corner downtown, where he and his friendly staff promise a good time for all. </p>

                                <h6>BAR MANAGER AND MIXOLOGIST</h6>
                                <p>Matt is a Tucson native who is no stranger to the city’s restaurant and bar scene.  He spent two years as a sushi chef, learning technique and foundation from Manhattan transplant, Fei Cheng.  It was this experience that reinforced for Matt the concept, “mis en place”.  Prior to Umi Star’s closing in January 2014, Matt worked as head chef and manager there, during which time he created and executed an entirely new menu.</p>
                                <p>Shortly thereafter, Matt worked at Nox as a bartender, but soon took his mixology skills over to 47 Scott.  During his time with Scott & Co., he helped create both seasonal and special events menus, along with his invention of 10 new and exciting cocktails.  His intelligent mixing and creativity is what earned Matt a trip to Louisville, Kentucky, as a regional winner of the Woodford Reserve Manhattan Experience.</p>
                                <p>Matt’s immediate plans for Obon’s bar will include a list of rotating classics, Japanese-influenced original cocktails, together with a widely varied sake list.  The fun won’t stop there, though, as Matt has visions of punch bowls, exotic, large-format cocktails and (fingers crossed) a frozen drink machine.  Matt is excited to bring a high quality bar to the busiest street corner downtown, where he and his friendly staff promise a good time for all. </p>
