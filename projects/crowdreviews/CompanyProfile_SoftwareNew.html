                    <p>Their SEO Woorank was forty three out of one hundred which was among the lowest of any company while doing my due diligence.

They were not Google Partner certified when I checked which would be a useful way to help validate their expertise in my opinion. Their website was professional overall yet there were minor text formatting and spelling issues, redundant links (which clicked but did not enable any movement) and a missing graphic on their website which were minor from a visitor standpoint, yet I understand search engine algorithms take this into consideration when factoring their rankings.

                    <h4>Overall Feedback</h4>
                    <p>This company provided pricing for their SEO packages on their home page and were extremely competitive. Certainly among the lowest I had seen out of all of the companies during my research. And while they had not met all of my presales criteria and there were minor issues in regards to attention to detail on their website, the fact I was able to verify some of their page one rankings along with the positive testimonials which were attached to these case studies was enough credibility that I looked forward to learning more about their service. And though they were among the finalists for our business, with a bit more attention to detail of their own SEO example perhaps we would have chosen this company, however, we went in another direction. Although I look forward to circling around in the future and seeing if they are the best fit for our other projects.</p>
