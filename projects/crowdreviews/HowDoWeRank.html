                <h2>Unbiased. Community Driven. Transparent.</h2>
                <p>CrowdReviews.com rates each product or service along 5 parameters for each category, depending on the products or services they offer.
                 These parameters are further made up of independently-verifiable, transparent factors that make our ranking algorithm truly unique. 
                 Some of the factors that go into making the model are detailed below. </p>
                 <h3>The first buyers guide which ranks products and services based on user reviews.</h3>

                    	<h4>Number of Reviews</h4>
                        <p>The algorithm takes into consideration the total number of reviews.</p>
                        <i>Example: A credit card processing company with lots of reviews will fare better than a credit card processing company that has fewer reviews.</i>

                        <i>Example: A web design company with lots of web design client reviews will fare better than a web design company that has a lot of Drupal development client reviews.</i>

                        <p>The average age of the review is a factor used by the algorithm to determine rankings.</p>
